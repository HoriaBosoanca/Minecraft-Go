# Downloading
### Linux
Download the game on [itch.io](https://redplayer333hhh.itch.io/raygocraft). 
Make sure you download both files and run the executable while it's in the same directory as the png.
Alternatively, git clone this repository and run it's executable.
# Building
### Linux
After cloning the repository and "cd"-ing into the project directory,
run the "go build" command to generate the executable.
One of the project dependencies (raylib-go) might require extra dependencies, 
which can be installed as described [here](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements).
