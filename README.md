# Downloading
### Linux
Run "git clone https://github.com/HoriaBosoanca/Raygocraft",
then "cd" into the project directory and run the executable with "./raygocraft". 
You may delete the source code, but not the assets folder.
# Building
### Linux
After running "git clone https://github.com/HoriaBosoanca/Raygocraft"
and "cd"-ing into the project directory, run the "go build" command to generate the executable.
One of the project dependencies (raylib-go) might require extra dependencies, 
which can be installed as described [here](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements).
